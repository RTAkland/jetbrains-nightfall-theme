Thank you for considering contributing to this project. Here you can find the guidelines on how to contribute.

If you have any question's feel free to contact me at brandoncoetzee64@gmail.com

## How Can I Contribute?

You can learn more about contributing to open source projects here: [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

### :bulb: Have a Suggestion or Experiencing a Problem?

Before you open a new issue, check to see if the problem or suggestion has [already been reported](https://github.com/brandii-co/jetbrains-nightfall-theme/issues). If it has and **the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of creating a new one.

> **Note:** If you find a **closed** issue that seems to address the same thing that you've found, open a new issue and include a link to the original one.

When you open an issue, try to be as descriptive as possible. Add any relevant screenshots so that the problem can be identified quickly.

### :ticket: Opening a Pull Request

If you've fixed a bug, started working on an enhancement, or done something else, you can [create a pull request](https://github.com/brandii-co/jetbrains-nightfall-theme/pulls) to start a conversation about your changes.

A pull request doesn't necessarily have to include finished work. It may be better to open a PR early on so that you can get feedback on your contribution. Just mention that it's a work in progress and keep adding commits.

Here's how to contribute and submit your pull request:

1. [**Fork the repository**](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and clone it locally. Add the original repository as a remote and pull in changes every so often so that you stay up to date with the project.
2. [**Create a branch**](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) from `main` for your changes.
3. **Add, commit, and push** your changes to your branch.
4. **Test out your changes.** Make sure that they work as you intended.
5. [**Open a pull request**](https://github.com/brandii-co/jetbrains-nightfall-theme/pulls) to merge your branch into `main`.
   - Reference any issues of suggestions that your PR may close if any, e.g. "Closes issue #12".
   - Describe your changes in detail and include screenshots if necessary.
6. Wait for your PR to be reviewed. You might have to tweak your contribution or elaborate on your changes.
